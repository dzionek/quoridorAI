    *** Part I.a (10pt) ***

    First, we will generate a tree containing all the possible game states.
-}

-- Given a game, return a tree that encodes all the possible future game states.
-- [Hint: Use 'validActions' and 'performAction'.]
-- [Note: To speed things up, you may want to, at this stage, heuristically select which actions are 
--  more relevant. In particular, you probably don't want to consider every single possible wall.]

{-
    *** PART I.b (5pt) ***

    Re-order the tree so that when traversed by the minimax algorithm, when it traverses the 
    branches at each node, finds either the higher scores or the lower scores first, depending on
    the depth of the tree.
-}

-- Higher scoring nodes go first.

{-
    *** Part I.c (5pt) ***

    We don't want to look at all possible future game states as that would consume too much time and
    memory. Instead, we will only look a given number of steps into the future. Formally, the future
    game states are encoded in a tree, so we need a function that reduces the depth of a tree.
-}

-- Given a depth and a tree, return the same tree but cutting off the branches when the depth is 
-- exceeded. 
-- [Hint: You may want to use guards and recursion.]
pruneDepth :: Int -> StateTree v a -> StateTree v a
pruneDepth = undefined

{-
    *** Part I.d (5pt) ***

    Similarly, we can also make our tree smaller by not considering all the possible game states at
    a given point. We need a function that reduces the breadth (or width) of a tree.
-}

-- Given a breadth (Int n) and a tree, return the same tree but only keeping the first n branches at
-- every node.

{-
    *** Part I.e (15pt) ***

    A crucial part of the minimax algorithm is defining a good utility function. It should measure
    how good a game position is for the current player. In our case, a game state should be better
    than another one if the player is closer to its winning positions.
-}

-- Assign a value to each game (from the point of view of the current player).
-- [Hint 1: You may want to calculate the distance between the player's current cell and its winning
--  positions.]
-- [Hint 2: One way would be to use 'reachableCells' repeatedly.]

{-
    *** Part I.f (20pt) ***

    Finally, we ask you to implement the minimax algorithm. Given an evaluation tree, it should 
    return the a high scoring action (according to the minimax algorithm).
-}

-- Given an evaluation tree (it stores a score in the node and each branch is labelled with the 
-- action that leads to the next child) return a list of actions
-- [Hint 1: Use a helper function to keep track of the highest and lowest scores.]
-- [Hint 2: Use the 'Result' datatype.]
minimaxFromTree :: EvalTree -> Action
minimaxFromTree = undefined

{-
    *** Part II (10pt) ***

    Extension of Part I.e, using alpha-beta pruning. You will need to change the 'minimax' function
    below to make it use this function.
-}

-- Same as above but now use alpha-beta pruning.
